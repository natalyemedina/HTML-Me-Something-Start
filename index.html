            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">There is more to traveling than checking out instagrammable spots, partying, and tours. There's also Salsa dacing, for example. Social dancing and Salsa classes inspired me travel abroad and I made friends along the way.</p>
            <section id="malaga">   
               <h2>Malaga, Spain</h2>
               <p>Malaga was my 1st favorite city in Europe. The acai bowls were to die for and the city is beautiful! My friend set up a hike at Caminito del Rey and it was breathtaking! I just couldn't wait to go Salsa dancing for the first time in Europe though! I fortunately met a girl at my hostel who loves dancing and we went to two socials together.</p>

               <h2>Barcelona, Spain</h2>
               <p>OK! Barcelona and Madrid are known for high level dancing and I had to check it out of course! I went to a Bachata class a friend recommended and was surprised to see the instructor was the famous instagram dancer Masahiro Nakagiri! I was very excited! I also participated in a couple of tours and found a piece of Santorini style homes in Barcelona! </p>

               <h2>Novi Sad, Serbia</h2>
               <p>I was eating at a vegan restaurant in Belgrade and asked my waiter for Salsa dancing recommendations. He asked some friends and got back to me about a Salsa Congress in Novi Sad, Serbia. I took the train the next day and met many people at the Salsa Congress. By the way, the best vegan food I tasted in the 11 countries I visited is in Belgrade! One of the people I met at the Salsa Congress told me about a Salsa festival in Hungary and another one told me about social dancing in Split, Croatia and so, I went.</p>

               <h2>Zagreb, Croatia</h2>
               <p>Zagreb! Oh my gosh Zagreb. The roads reminded me of France. IT IS BEAUTIFUL!!! I loved the public transportation system. I made it to two Salsa classes and a social. It was easy to connect with the locals and the travelers from the hostel. Oh, this sounds weird but there's a beautiful instagrammable cemeteray worth visiting.</p>

            <section id="split">
               <h2>Split, Croatia</h2>
               <p>We have made it to my favorite place on my trip! I fell in love with Split. I would move HERE! The people I met at the social were the friendliest! I loved that there was Salsa and Bachata classes Monday-Thursday. A girl I met in class invited me to join an all woman expat group and there, I made another friend. I explored with the locals and the people I met at the hostels when I wasn't at the socials and classes. The locals taught me a lot of Croatian words, they practiced the Spanish they learned from telenovelas with me, and they took me in as one of their own. I walked a bunch, explored castles, and lived a bit more of the hostel life. I loved the dancing and community so much I stayed a week and returned another week after visiting Dubrovnik and Montenegro.</p>

               <h2>Budapest, Hungary</h2>
               <p>Hungary wasn't on my list of countries to visit but I am glad I took that friend's recommendation. I went for a Salsa Congress and also got to explore the city. It is surprisingly beautiful. My favorite part, aisde from the Salsa Congress, was my tour of the city and reconnecting with a Salsa teacher and other dancers I met at the Novi Sad Salsa Congress. I also connected with two Salsa teachers from London at this Congress and they invited me to London for their classes.</p>

               <h2>London, England</h2>
               <p>We have made it to the last place I visited for dancing, London. London was scary. Everyone is in a rush! You have to be careful taking the tube! Finding a good hostel was also tough. Nonetheless, it's nice to say I was in London, even if it was just for a night. That was enough for me. Therefore, I don't have any pictures.</p>
